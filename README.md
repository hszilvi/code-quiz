## My_process
At first I wrote the pseucodes to create a "to do" list before create the code.
Using thsese pseucodes I created the functions.
Later I made the code shorter and separated functions as I revisioned my code.
It was challanging to display data from local storage. 

I wrote the readme.md with the relative path to screen shot and links and other expected contents. 

### Built_with
Javascript, VS code

## What_I_learned
I learned a lot about Javascript functions. 

### Continued_developement
- deeper understanding of functions
